# GreenRace - API

You will find the website for which I'm building an API [here][0b412c79].

## Technologies used

- Fat Free Framework

## How to install

Getting the project up and running is really simple.

1. Clone the project : `git clone https://github.com/LogLauncher/greenrace-api.git`
2. Open the created folder : `cp greenrace-api`
3. Start the php server : `php -S localhost:8080`
4. Open your favorite browser and enter this url : http://localhost:8080

**Warning:** You need to have php installed on your machine. If that is not the case follow the instructions [here](https://www.sitepoint.com/how-to-install-php-on-windows/).

## How it works

1) Generate a UID
2) Set the vehicles
3) Set the steps
4) Set any options
5) Run the calculation
